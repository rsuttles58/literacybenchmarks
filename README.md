# Literacy Benchmarks
Literacy Benchmarks is intended to be a simple tool built to support parents in managing and understanding their child's early development.  Early on the tool will track unique words that a child says in an easy to enter app and show a parent how the child's verbal development compares to benchmarks based on the child's age.
